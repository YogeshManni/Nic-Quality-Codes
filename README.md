  #### Article 1: What is Code Quality & why is it Important

 **URL** - https://www.codegrip.tech/productivity/what-is-code-quality-why-is-it-important/#:~:text=A%20quality%20code%20is%20one,been%20in%20talks%20since%201970.
 - [x] Code quality is a fundamental aspect of software development.
 - [x] Developers spend a significant amount of time reviewing and fixing code, which impacts productivity.
 - [x] High-quality code is clear, simple, well-tested, bug-free, refactored, documented, and performant.
 - [x] Code quality has been a concern since the 1970s, and around 90% of businesses use code review tools to improve it.
 - [x] Key metrics for measuring code quality include reliability, maintainability, testability, portability, and reusability.
 - [x] Poor code quality leads to technical debt and software obsolescence.
 - [x] Developers often ignore code quality due to heavy workloads and tight deadlines.
 - [x] Lack of comprehensive and budget-friendly code review tools is a common challenge.
 - [x] Code quality is essential because it:
      - [x] Makes software robust by handling errors gracefully.
      - [x] Increases readability and ease of editing, promoting inter-team learning.
      - [x] Ensures program sustainability over time.
      - [x] Facilitates easy transferability across platforms.
      - [x] Decreases technical debt, reducing the need for constant code changes.
 - [x] Code quality can be improved using tools like CodeGrip, which streamline code analysis, error detection, and resolution.
 - [x] Automated code review tools, like CodeGrip, are essential for maintaining software quality in the long term.

#### Article 2: What Is Code Quality? Overview + How to Improve Code Quality

 **URL** - https://www.perforce.com/blog/sca/what-code-quality-overview-how-improve-code-quality
 - [x]  Code quality is subjective and context-dependent, varying among different development teams.
- [x]  High-quality code is clean, follows a consistent style, is easy to understand, well-documented, and testable.
- [x]  Manual code reviews and testing have limitations in finding all code errors.
- [x]  Poor code quality can introduce safety and security risks in software.
- [x]  Quality is everyone's responsibility in the development process.
- [x]  Code quality can be measured using various metrics, including reliability, maintainability, testability, portability, and reusability.
- [x]  Defect and complexity metrics are essential for measuring overall code quality.
- [x]  Improving code quality involves using coding standards, analyzing code early, following code review best practices, and refactoring legacy code when necessary.
- [x]  Code quality tools like static analyzers (e.g., Helix QAC and Klocwork) play a crucial role in ensuring high-quality code.
- [x]  Monitoring key quality metrics, such as cyclomatic complexity, helps maintain code quality over time.

#### Article 3: Code Quality: What It Is and How To Measure It (With Tips)

 **URL** - https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/what-is-code-quality
- [x] Code quality measures the value of code in terms of consistency, functionality, and ease of understanding.
 - [x] High-quality code is functional, consistent, easy to understand, meets client needs, testable, reusable, bug-free, secure, and well-documented.
 - [x] Code quality is crucial for enhancing the end user's experience and ensuring software safety and reliability.

 - [x] Code quality can be measured by reliability, complexity, portability, reusability, and testability.
 - [x] Reliability measures a program's ability to function without failure over time.
 - [x] Complexity is assessed using metrics like cyclomatic complexity, where lower complexity indicates higher quality.
 - [x] Portability examines how well code can be used in different environments.
 - [x] Reusability measures whether code can be repurposed for other projects.
 - [x] Testability evaluates how well the code supports testing efforts.

  **Tips for Improving Code Quality:**

 - [x] Follow coding best practices, including adhering to coding standards and guidelines.
 - [x] Simplify complex code to make it easier to read and maintain.
 - [x] Consider using code-checking tools to automatically suggest improvements.
 - [x] Align code with common coding techniques to enhance reusability and maintainability.
 - [x] Periodically improve old code to keep it up to date and efficient.
